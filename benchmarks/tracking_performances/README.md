Method to produce the tracking performances with ePIC tracker
The scripts can be used to create the debug plots for the momentum resolutions.

To run a full simulation-reconstruction-analysis chain do:
```
snakemake --cores 1 tracking_performance
```

It will produce the results with truth/realistic seeding.
