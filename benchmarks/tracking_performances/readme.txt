Method to produce the tracking performances with ePIC tracker
The scripts can be used to create the debug plots for the momentum resolutions.
In the first step enter inside eic-shell and create a directory (your preferred name) there and put all the script inside that.
Simply run the command source Script_widebin.sh
It will produce the results with truth/realistic seeding.
